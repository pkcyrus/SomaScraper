# SomaScraper
A web-scraper for compiling playlist data from somafm built on javafx, sqlite, and jsoup.

A good portion of this project was just acclimating to using JavaFX.  It was precipitated by my friend losing access to streaming their music at work while somafm simultaneously stopped posting their playlists to twitter.  The goal was to help her build her own playlists using similar music without having to stop and write down all the song names.

I am in no way affiliated with SomaFM, this project is an independent work.

Project files are for IntelliJ IDEA.

Scraping is automated through windows' task scheduler and a .bat file

The email component was to automate delivering the playlist to interested parties automatically.

The actual UI was layered on top as an exercise.
